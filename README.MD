# \_S Library - Your String's Best Friend

## Overview

Welcome to \_S, where strings come to have fun! Our library is like a Swiss Army knife for strings in JavaScript. Need to make a string look pretty? Check. Turn it upside down? Maybe not yet, but we're getting there. We've got everything from basic string operations to fancy stuff like extracting data, validating content, and keeping secrets (shh, don't tell the passwords!).

## Features

- **Data Extraction and Analysis**: Like a detective, but for strings. We find numbers, words, and probably Waldo if he's hiding in there.
- **Specialized String Operations**: It's like string gymnastics – we calculate distances, check balance, and more.
- **Masking and Security**: We're the mask heroes for your strings, protecting identities and sensitive data.
- **String Analysis and Validation**: String therapists, at your service. We listen, analyze, and validate.
- **Case Manipulation**: Ever wanted to shout in text or whisper quietly? We've got the case changes for every mood.
- **Whitespace Handling**: Managing whitespace like a pro – we trim, we squish, we expand.
- **Date and Time Formatting**: We're basically time travelers, formatting your dates and times like it's no big deal.
- **Text Transformations and Utilities**: General magic tricks for your text. Poof! And it's transformed.

## Installation

Install \_S and watch your strings do backflips:

```bash
npm install _S
```

Or if you're more of a yarn person:

```bash
yarn add _S
```

## Usage Examples

### Extract Numbers from a String

Got numbers hiding in your text? We'll find them. It's like hide and seek, but with digits.

```javascript
import { extractNumbers } from "_S";

const text = "Order 500 units of item 1234.";
const numbers = extractNumbers(text); // Found them! [500, 1234]
```

### Check for Balanced Brackets

Ever wonder if your brackets are socially balanced? Let's find out together.

```javascript
import { isBalancedBrackets } from "_S";

const validString = "(Hello [World])";
const isValid = isBalancedBrackets(validString); // True, these brackets are in harmony
```

### Mask Email Address

Protect your email like a superhero protects their identity.

```javascript
import { maskEmail } from "_S";

const email = "user@example.com";
const maskedEmail = maskEmail(email); // Secret identity: "u***@example.com"
```

### Reverse String

Flip your string on its head, because why not?

```javascript
import { reverseString } from "_S";

const original = "desserts";
const reversed = reverseString(original); // Stressed out? Have some "stressed"
```

### Case Toggle

Turn your string into a rollercoaster of cases - uppercase, lowercase, we ride them all.

```javascript
import { toggleCase } from "_S";

const mixed = "WhO sAiD cOnSiStEnCy MaTtErS?";
const toggled = toggleCase(mixed); // wHo sAiD CoNsIsTeNcY mAtTeRs?
```

### Trim Whitespace

Give your string a neat trim, because everyone loves a well-groomed text.

```javascript
import { trimWhitespace } from "_S";

const messy = "  Too much space?   ";
const neat = trimWhitespace(messy); // "Too much space?"
```
